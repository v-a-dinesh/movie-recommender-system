## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/v-a-dinesh/movie-recommender-system.git
   cd movie-recommender-system
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   OMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   Get your free API key from [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)

5. **Prepare the data files**
   
   Place the following files in the `data/` directory:
   - `movie_list.pkl`: Preprocessed movie dataset
   - `similarity.pkl`: Precomputed similarity matrix

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üîß Configuration

### Streamlit Configuration

The app uses a custom dark theme defined in `.streamlit/config.toml`:

```toml
[theme]
base = "dark"
primaryColor = "#FF4B4B"
backgroundColor = "#0E1117"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#262730"
textColor = "#FAFAFA"
```

### API Configuration

The application uses OMDB API for fetching movie details. Free tier includes:
- 1,000 requests per day
- Poster images
- Movie metadata

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: The system loads preprocessed movie data and similarity matrix
2. **User Selection**: User selects a movie from the dropdown menu
3. **Similarity Calculation**: The system finds the most similar movies based on content features
4. **API Integration**: Fetches real-time movie information from OMDB API
5. **Display Results**: Shows top 5 recommendations with similarity scores

### Content-Based Filtering Algorithm

The recommendation system uses content-based filtering which:
- Analyzes movie features (genre, keywords, cast, crew)
- Calculates similarity scores between movies
- Recommends movies with highest similarity scores
